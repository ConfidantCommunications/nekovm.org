# Changes in Neko 1.2

This release include several major changes : 

- runtime exceptions : several operations that were returning `null`before are now raising an exception. This is the case for invalid function calls (not a function or invalid number of arguments), object field access (for example null.x) , array access (still null if outside of bounds) and numerical operations.

- linker : using `nekoc -link` you can now link a lot of .n bytecode files together into a single standalone .n file

- nekoboot : this utility enable you to create standalone executables from a single bytecode file

- renaming : the neko virtual machine is now named `neko` (instead of nekovm) and both neko and nekoml compilers are named `nekoc` and `nekoml`. Compilers are built using nekoboot and are then standalon executables (this is more easy to use, simply `nekoc myfile.neko`).

- TCO : tail recursion optimizations in Neko

- Object Prototypes : object can now have chained prototype (see Language Reference Documentation)

- standard library : added UTF8 support, improved XML parser, and other useful primitives as well

- licence change : Neko 1.2 is now LGPL while Neko 1.1 was GPL
